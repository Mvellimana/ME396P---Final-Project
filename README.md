# SynMusic
_**A simple music transcriptor and reproducer using SciPy**_
## How To Use It!


### Representing Music Visually 
Although music is a sonic phenomena, there are multiple ways to suncintly depict it graphically. Sheet music is one of them and it allows to represent the arrangement of pitches over time in staff notation. It uses an array of symbols and codes to precisely (but not necesarly intuitively) convey the fundamental elements of a piece of music, namely, pitch, rythm , dynamics, and timbre.
